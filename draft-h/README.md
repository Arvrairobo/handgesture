## Brief Introduction of the project of Team Echo

Almost people use a desktop or laptop these days. One of serious problem is that we are stuck to the keyboard and mouse, which will cause a serious health problem on a long run. Moreover in VR/AR age, we cannot use keyboard/mouse. Our purpose is to replace a keyboard and mouse with hand gestures. We have devised a virtual keyboard and virtual mouse with subtle hand gestures and made ML recognise our gestures so that we can control our computer remotely. Amazon echo has ear now. It will have eye in future. We need to make a standard gestures for people to adopt easily like a standard keyboard and mouse. ML will address this for us, human. We used Deep Learning as ML in this project.

## Introduction

People have used a keyboard and mouse as a standard way of input to computer for a long time. One of the serious problem of using keyboard and mouse is that we are stuck to the keyboard/mouse and sit still while we are using our desktop or laptop computer. This causes a serious health problem on a long run. 

Moreover we are entering the VR ( Virtual reality )/ AR ( Augmented reality ) age and we cannot use keyboard/mouse as we did before. We have to use some kind of mobile controller or GESTURE !!!

ML( Machine Learning ) can recognise our gesture and control the computer as we intented by gesture remotely.
We will feel like a magician. And by moving our body to control the computer, we can avoid sitting still and getting a health problem. Moreover we can play a game with much more immersive experience by moving our hands, heads and body.

To replace a keyboard and mouse, we have to devise many subtle gestures and these gestures have to be easy one for people to learn easily like a standard keyboard and mouse. It may be annoying if we have to learn different gestures to control different devices in future.

We suggest a standard virtual keyboard and standard virtual mouse like following. The goal of this project is to search a possibility of using these subtle gestures to control a computer upto the level to replace a keyboard and mouse completely.


## Hand Gestures as a Standard Way to replace a Keyboard and Mouse

We have two hands normally. We can use one hand for keyboard and the other for a mouse.
The standard gestures should be easy for people to learn easily. Just imagine that there is a virtual keyboard in front of your left side and virtual mouse on your right side. Lets focus on virtual keyboard first.

We divided the left side into three region

1. left region
2. middle region
3. right region

We can make 10 easy distinct gesture on each region:

1. closed hand
2. open hand
3. thumb only
4. additional index finger
5. additional middle finger
6. folding first finger
7. folding second finger
8. folding middle finger
9. folding index finger
10 folding thumb

If we use 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as inputs, we have 5 * 3 = 15 different gestures in each region and 15 * 3 = 45 gestures in total region.

If we use 3, 4, 5 as control, we have 3 * 3 = 9 controls and 45 * 9 = 135 different gestures which will cover the whole range of keys ( numbers, lower alphabet, upper alphabet, special keys and controls )

For a mouse, we can have 10 same gestures as left hand, which cover whole inputs from mouse. Our center of hand is a mouse cursor. The mouse cursor of computer will track the center of the right hand.

For a left-handed people, of course we can swap the left and right.
