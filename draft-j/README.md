# Use hand gestures to controll keyboard/mouse



## Project Outline

> All most people use a desktop or laptop these days. One of serious problem is that they are stuck to the keyboard and mouse, which will cause a serious health problem on a long run. Moreover in VR/AR age, we cannot use keyboard/mouse. Our purpose is to replace a keyboard and mouse with hand gestures. We created virtual keyboard and virtual mouse with subtle hand gestures and made ML recognise our gestures so that we can control our computer remotely. Amazon echo has ear now but it will have eye in future. We need to make a standard gestures for people to adopt easily like a standard keyboard and mouse. ML will do this for us, human.
