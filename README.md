## Controlling a Computer by Hand Gesture

It would be nice to controll a computer by hand gesture and/or voice remotely without using a keyboard and a mouse. 

This can make people freed from the keyboard and mouse, solving the health problem caused by sitting steady for a long time.

Additionally this makes game-players feel more immersive in a game by using their body for interaction.

Currently VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) use a special controller to replace the keyboard and the mouse for performance reason.

Ideally these controller will be replaced with hand gestures and voice commands.

There have been many researches about this hand gesture recognition. What we are going to achieve is to cover all the keys on a keyboard with as many hand gestures as possible. 

## recent works in this field

1. [CMU university's openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)

2. [MS's hand tracking](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/fully-articulated-hand-tracking/)

3. [leap motion](https://www.leapmotion.com)

4. [mano motion](https://www.manomotion.com/)


## chalenging points

1. using a webcam not using 3D sensor or depth camera

2. detecting the subtle gestures at real time

3. deep learning at smartphone if possible


## work flow

1. defining as many hand gestures as possible to cover all the keys on a keyboard.

2. creating many data sets accordingly.

3. searching for a deep learning model which can track and recognise these hand gestures at real time.

4. searching for a deep learning model which can track a hand to be used as replacement of a mouse at real time.

5. creating some demos such as basic calculation or a game.
