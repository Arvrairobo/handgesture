## Controlling a Computer by Hand Gesture

It would be nice to controll a computer by hand gesture and/or voice remotely. 

This can make people freed from the keyboard and mouse, solving the health problem caused by sitting steady for a long time.

If applied for a game, this makes playersfeel more immersive by interacting with their body gesture.

The interaction with hand gesture is necessary for VR/AR age.
